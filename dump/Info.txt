These are some files i found lying around in an old github repo i made a long long time ago. I tried to revive shellcore command but was compeltly stupid and didnt know how to do it. This is a dump of some old art made by another person and my 1st draft of the shellcore command lore i made.
The lore is filled with cliches and bad writting in adition to old memes. But i think with heavy polishing it can be cleaned up and be made into an actually good draft for the lore. Also i copy pasted it from some old discord messages I made so they timestamps are going to have to be deleted.
